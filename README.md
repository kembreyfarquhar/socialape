# Social Ape

This project is a full-featured social media application. Users may sign up with email and password, post "screams", like and comment on screams, update their profile information and photo, and receive notifications when other users have like or commented on one of their screams. 

> For this project I used **TypeScript** and **Firebase cloud functions**
